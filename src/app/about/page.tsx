Helga Wretman is an artist based in Berlin. Her practice explores the shifting
relationship between body, identity, and digital culture through performance,
video, and forms of social interaction.
Her works arise from an attention to the body as a site of tension—between
strength and fragility, exposure and control, presence and disappearance.
Through carefully staged actions and moments of improvisation, she creates
situations in which the choreography of everyday life becomes visible and
the body becomes a tool for reflection, resistance, and reinvention.
